React - library used to build UI

Node.js - runtime environment for JS.

Why React?
 - It doesnt render the entire page whereas it only renders what has been modified.
 - Virtual DOM - copy of the actual DOM - it is stored in the local.

 event -> virtual DOM  (compares the changes with Real DOm and only modify that particular change.)
                  -> real DOM.

 - High performant;
 - Light weighted;
 - Popular library and larger community support.

 To setup react project
  npx create-react-app <project-name> -> it will create a new directory and populate all the files needed for react.
  npx create-react-app . -> it uses the current directory/folder.


JSX - JS + XML

<div>
<span>


React uses component architecture.

Component -> function that returns an html element.

React App -> single-page application
